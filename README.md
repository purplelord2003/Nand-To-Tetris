# Nand-To-Tetris
### An online course offered by the University of Jerusalem that allows the building of a computer from the very basic logic gates. This file contains the descriptions of the work done during each project.

## Overview of each project

### Project 1
We set out to learn about Boolean algebra and logic gates, we set out to create 15 elementary logic gates from a primitive logic gate, Nand, and the gates built along the way.

The truth table for Nand logic gate:

### Project 2
In this project, we built 4 more chips as well as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) which is the computational centerpiece of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) of our computer.

### Project 3
We now use the primitive chip DFF (Data Flip-Flop) to create more chips, this time to store memory over time. At the end of this project, we build various registers, different sizes of RAM (Random Access Memory) as well as the Program Counter.

### Project 4
We familiarise ourselves with a particular assembly language designed by the course instructors to write low-level assembly programs that will later be passed onto the CPU emulator to carry out tasks.

### Project 5
This is the cornerstone project where we create the entire Memory unit (consisting of the RAM and ROM) and CPU unit. The CPU and the Memory are combined to create the fundamental architecture of computer hardware.

### Project 6
We build an assembler to convert the assembly code to machine-level code (consisting only of bits of 0's and 1's). For this project, I used Python to build the assembler that will work for any assembly code written in the assembly language used in the course.

## Conclusion
This course is a good introduction to understanding how modern computers came about in the first place, diving in depth all the way to the minuscule logic gates they were built upon. The second part of the course is to build the software upon this hardware we have already constructed, which I am strongly considering to enroll in soon.
